- Hypothesis: there are only four categories of complexity in software information systems:
	- platform
	- information model
	- distributed system
	- responsive UI
- Evidence: here is a notion database of kinds of complexity, organized by category. https://dustingetz.notion.site/ec2e6df5b22045ab84eeb3aac78b1efa
- Agree or disagree? Please reply with examples and counter-examples, and I will add them to the database!

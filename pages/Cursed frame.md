- A cursed communication frame is one in which the participants have incompatible frames of reference, which makes the participants unable to align and agree upon the purpose of the exchange. When this occurs, one or both participants are unaccepting of the other's contributions and therefore no constructive exchange can occur. The result is that the communication attempt fails, leaving one or both parties feeling frustrated and rejected.
- Examples:
	- Both participants see themselves as superior and the other inferior
		- [[The Curse of Development]]
			- Student cannot trust the teacher or no obvious credential of authority to anchor the frame
			- Teacher attempting to teach an unwilling student
			- Student cannot trust the teacher has their interests at heart
	- A participant doesn't realize what they really want from the exchange
		- One person states they want advice but actually wants empathy; other person fails to recognize this and gives rational advice instead of listening.

	- In mathematics, an algebra is a set of elements along with a collection of operations (such as addition, multiplication, etc.) that obey certain rules and properties. These rules and properties define how the elements can be combined, manipulated, and related to each other. The study of algebra aims to understand the underlying structures and relationships between elements and operations, and to solve problems using these structures. In a simple and concise definition, algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols, variables, and the rules for manipulating them.

- The CAC problem occurs when a market is **fragmented** with many alternatives, resulting in high cost to bring customers to *your* product (i.e. CAC > LTV).
	- CAC = customer acquisition cost
	- LTV = customer lifetime value
- Suppose you naively intend to dominate an entire category and beat all incumbents. How do you reach the users in a fragmented category?
- Assume generously:
	- for the first market segment,
	- we invest in building a channel,
	- we can reach exactly the right user,
	- on the exact day that they are feeling the pain,
	- and the product does exactly the right thing,
	- and he understands that it's the right thing,
	- and he decides to try it,
	- and a great 30% activation rate,
	- and great retention;
- At each of these steps there is some large probability of losing the prospect, so that is already a large CAC. And now you have to repeat the process for each new segment, rebuild the channels, rebuild new content.

	- (a) has the technical problem
	- (b) realizes they need this tool
	- (c) doesn't want to build it themselves
	- (d) can integrate easily

- **6 ways to beat the CAC problem**
	- Clear solution to an unusual/weird problem and everyone with that problem chooses you (e.g. Replit for students)
	- 5 figure ACV (e.g. Retool). For midmarket contracts, CAC is well under LTV so there is no problem. (Series B cos pay Heap $100k, Segment 100k, Salesforce 250-300k, smaller vendors 30-40k)
	- ultra-premium price (7-8 figure ACV) so one contract is enough, e.g. sell deeptech to high finance.
	- Solve an unsolved segment (e.g. Roam owned PKM) (but note to reach the market Roam also needed viral growth and strong personality - "roamcult")
	- hyper-specialize ("low-code for oil&gas enterprise corporate treasuries that trade energy asset derivatives")
	- **real solution = you need a network effect**

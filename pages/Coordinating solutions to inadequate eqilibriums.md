	- "Of course the social problems of poverty actually arise in complex social systems where different equilibria are much harder to identify than in this simple example. In a game that has many equilibria, there are typically many more strategy combinations that are not Nash equilibria. **A would-be reformer who wants to improve social welfare by changing people's behavior to a better equilibrium must take care to identify a social plan that is in fact a Nash equilibrium, so that nobody can profit by unilaterally deviating from the plan.** If a leader tries to change people's expectations to some plan that is not a Nash equilibrium, then his exhortations to change behavior would be undermined by rational deviations. The point of this example is that, **even when the better equilibrium is well understood, there still remains a nontrivial social problem of how to change everyone's expectations to the better equilibrium.** Such coordinated social change requires some form of socially accepted leadership, and thus it may depend on factors that are essentially political."

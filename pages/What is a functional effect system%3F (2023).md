	- A functional effect system is a way of managing side effects in functional programming languages by explicitly representing effects as values. This allows for a more controlled and predictable handling of side effects, making the code easier to reason about, test, and maintain. In a functional effect system, effects are typically represented as monads, arrows, or other composable structures, and the operations are combined and sequenced using specific combinators.
	- Algebraic effects, on the other hand, are a more general and abstract way of representing side effects in programming languages. They decouple the definition of an effect from its implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity. Algebraic effects are defined by a set of operations and their signatures, while their actual implementations, called handlers, are provided separately. This separation of concerns enables easier composition and reuse of effectful code.
	- The main difference between functional effect systems and algebraic effects lies in how they represent and handle side effects. While functional effect systems use specific structures (like monads) to model effects as values, algebraic effects provide a more abstract mechanism that separates the effect's definition from its implementation. This can lead to more modular and composable code in the case of algebraic effects. However, both approaches aim to make the management of side effects more controlled and predictable in functional programming.

title:: What is the business value of strong composition? (2022)

- For a long time I thought Hyperfiddle's key benefit was strong composition, but I was confused.
- Strong composition is not a key benefit (*what* is the thing the user seeks?), nor a key differentiator (*how* does it work?), but rather a *value* (an important belief that shapes one's decision making).
- Having teased this apart, now I can pitch the *benefit* of strong composition in a way that speaks to a user's need:
	- For savvy product engineering teams with large UI surface area, Photon is a domain specific programming language specialized for web UI. It lets you use plain function composition to wire up complex UIs without pain, bugs, or thinking about data plumbing *ever*. Unlike existing web frameworks that separate frontend and backend, Photon's “distributed dataflow” architecture reunites frontend and backend into a coherent reactive expression.
- **Key Benefits** (*what* is the unique value I get from your thing?)
	- plain function composition
	- no pain, bugs, or thinking about data plumbing ever
	- no schedule slips due to unplanned work
	- never have to tell your boss "it doesn't work like that" ever again
	- no debugging, no QA/test pain, no JIRA ticket pain
- **Key Differentiators** (That's crazy or not credible, *how* can that be possible?)
	- distributed dataflow architecture
	- compiler-managed network
	- zero plumbing code because it is inferred by the language
	- lightweight (5000 LOC for entire stack)
- **Values** (important beliefs that guide us)
	- strong composition (lambda)
	- personal mastery
- **Principles** (things we hold axiomatic that guide our values)
	- uncompromising power
	- human potential manifests in individuals
- > “**If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. Human potential manifests itself in individuals.** To realize this potential, we must provide a medium that can be mastered by a single individual. Any barrier that exists between the user and some part of the system will eventually be a barrier to creative expression. Any part of the system that cannot be changed or that is not sufficiently general is a likely source of impediment.”

- In mathematics, many functions are *universal*
  universal = aliens from our same universe also have this function
  universal = "including or covering all or a whole collectively or distributively without limit or exception"
- For example, cosine
  cosine is *essential*
  essential = Constituting or being part of the nature or essence of something; inherent.
  Essential functions are *discovered*, not designed or built
  Evidence of "discovery" is that Calculus was discovered twice, independently
- The cosine function can be *computed* in many ways
  Taylor series
  Euler's identity
  It need not be computed at all: it also can be physically measured
  It's not interesting which implementation is chosen, how long or short it is, or if it is computable –
  that is *implementation details*
- Essential functions like cosine are *abstraction* in the purest form –
  abstraction = "the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events"
  abstraction = "freedom from representational qualities"
  abstraction = "a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts"
- An abstraction is separated from its *implementation*.
  The implementation simply does not matter.
  The implementation also must not leak or you have a *leaky abstraction*.
  (which is to say, not an abstraction at all.)
	- > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction
	  > Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, selecting only those aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball. In a type–token distinction, a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').
- In mathematics, there are many infinity of functions
  but only a small number of essential functions
  These essential functions (that make up e.g. Calculus and Trigonometry) are taught to students
  They are the same functions in every country 
  and every human shares the same definitions.
- From this *unity* of understanding
  we can construct proofs and reproduce their correctness.
  We can create strong mental models that don't leak, and therefore scale
  to incredibly large ideas like space ships and digital computers
- So, as computer scientists, what does it mean?
	- essential functions are better
	  universal abstractions are better
	  if it's not universal, that means there's accidental complexity. Strive to label it
	  Non-essential functions are also accidental complexity. Strive to label it
- As to how to apply this to our work on Photon and Missionary:

  I'll leave that as a thought exercise. It is probably different for each of us.

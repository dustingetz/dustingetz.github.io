	- tasks
	- notes
	- files
	- folders

- Good structure mirrors your way of thinking. If you impose an identical (or at least similar) structure, you optimize your cognitive efforts and reduce switching costs.

- tool/structure impedance mismatches cause:
	- losses
	- mistakes
	- wasted time
	- frustration

- 4 fundamental structures of information
	- Lists
	- Grids
	- Trees
	- Networks / Graphs
-
- Those structures operate on top of the general elements:
	- Entities
	- Relations
	- Classes
	- Objects
	- Attributes

- How to design your structure
	- Define the set of specific entities you work with. This could be project, idea, build, article, goal etc.
	- Define the relationship between those. Now you have your own schema.
	- Use a system of queries to access and manipulate objects.

- Instead of fighting the tide and looking for "one platform to rule them all," formulate your Project List and then replicate that list across every single tool you use, now and in the future... I've noticed that people tend to use different organizational schemes in every program they use. They try to adapt a different scheme to the capabilities of each program, forcing their brains to "load up" and remember a different one every time they switch programs. — Tiago Forte

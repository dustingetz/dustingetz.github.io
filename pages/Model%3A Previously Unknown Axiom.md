- Blind spots are how smart people fail
	- Blind spots = undetected assumption
		- "Assumptions are what gets you killed"
		- unknown unknowns
	- Blind spots -> over-confidence -> broken assumptions -> killed
	- **Smart person fallacy**
		- smart people get less feedback, you can only trust yourself
		- they've corrected for other forms of error, so when they do make the occasional mistake, it is of this category (blind spot)
	- **Blind spots are insidious – they are impossible to detect** without external feedback
		- being smarter doesn't help
	- Expertise is local, nobody is expert at everything
- How to compensate
	- Feedback
		- high frequency
		- see control theory
		- unbiased third party observer
		- feedback is hard
			- real feedback requires trust
			- you must constantly seek it
			- you must reward it when you get it
				- Powerful phrase: **"Thank you for the feedback"**
		- Listen carefully
	- Mapping
		- Mapping the territory is how you identify where the possible blind spots are
			- Concept maps, e.g. science and math
			- **Know what is known**
		- Maps are exhaustive, they show you the entire space
		- obviously you need the right map (blind spot at meta level)
			- map the maps ...
		- Collect frameworks and mental models
			- your index of maps, i.e. meta map
	- Analysis (writing)
		- Do you really know? Or do you just like seeing yourself as someone who knows things?
			- Powerful phrase: "How do you know?"
		- Writing makes you accountable to yourself
			- How do I know? prove it to yourself
		- Writing as a synthesis activity
			- Compare to formal learning process (i.e. at university)
				- textbook -> lecture -> homework -> quiz -> lab -> midterm exam -> final exam
					- synthesis – if you don't do the homework you won't pass the test!
					- feedback – how do you know you know
		- Knowledge decay

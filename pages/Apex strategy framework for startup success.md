- Why
	- People are good at imagining a world over long period of time; but it's very hard to map that into a sequence of steps. This framework helps you break a mission down into the next achievable chunk and actionable sequence of next steps.
	- this model scales to 10,000 employees, $20B market cap
- Background
	- Apex Strategy = Mission → GTM → Product → Roadmap → Finance
		- In exactly this order!!!
	- Mission = why the company exists; the change in the world (people) you are bringing about
	- GTM = how will you reach the people in your market?
		- work = force * displacement; if you haven't moved anyone, you haven't done any work!
	- This is why GTM comes before product; **if you can't reach the market you don't have a startup**
		- Therefore, **Startup = Growth**
			- Growth = rate of change
			- Time is the denominator
	- The product you build is informed by and entangled with the GTM strategy
		- business milestones are growth milestones
			- the purpose of runway is to invest in growth
			- growth is the thing your capital is buying
			- a product that isn't growing is not even a product
		- does the product have viral elements engineered into the design?
		- do you have a documentation product?
		- do you have open source devkit and demos?
		- do you have a trial version? is there licensing/DRM features?
		- do certain market segments require specialized features sooner?
		- does the product have problems in practice that are slowing down growth?
		- If you pivot to a new GTM strategy, how do the features change?
- Framework: Apex Strategy -> functional area strategy -> milestones -> issues
	- Apex Strategy is the change you're making in the world, it's about people
		- What is your mission and [[Positioning statement]]?
		- "Strategy is not an endpoint; strategy is direction"
		- A strategy is only useful in that it tells you what to do next.
	- Apex strategy is broken down into three sub-strategies:
		- (1) **GTM** strategy – always and forever paramount!
			- 12mo and 3yr are the most useful points for determining GTM
		- (2) **Product** strategy, informed by (1)
		- (3) **Finance** strategy, informed by (1) & (2)
	- Strict order of importance
		- "don't let the tail wag the dog"
		- finance pulls future actions into the present by executing more steps in parallel
		- Yes at early stage the finance strategy puts a lot of constraints on things but still
		- Must be in alignment with one another
	- The three sub-categories map directly to three functional areas
		- Market development - finding the next set of customers/users
		- Product engineering (product and eng may be the same team at early stage)
		- Investor relations
- Process for executing against your Apex Strategy
	- First, set the Apex Strategy.
	- Next, figure out your 9 month goals.
		- Monthly, ask:
			- For this Apex Strategy, how does Founder judge the success of Company in {36, 18, 9} months?
				- What do customers look like?
				- What are they doing?
				- How have their lives changed?
		- Mark: My practice is to take some arbitrary distant timeframe (3 years say) and break it in half. I stopped at 9 months because your answer felt like a well defined, plan-able, achievable chunk to execute on.
			- You can start with 15 years (to establish direction) but the intent is to focus in on what matters right now.
	- Now we have our 9 month goals. How will we achieve them?
		- Those goals map to the 3 functional areas (GTM, Eng, Finance)
		- Add a 4th question for lieutenants to answer for their functional area:
			- How did we do it?
				- This is the action plan
		- Hand these 9 month goals to the lieutenants of each functional area and ask them to produce a plan for how to achieve it.
			- See: [[Minimum Viable Plan]]
	- Now we have a plan, how do we communicate it to stakeholders? (investors, employees, customers)
		- You need to have a solid story that:
			- explains what you're doing
			- simple enough that anyone can understand
			- and they can understand their role in the plan
	- Monthly, repeat/revise this exercise personally, and then realign with lieutenants (this is a goal setting exercise)
		- The framework does NOT call for a top-line metric like revenue or contracts out in the future.
			- Only for 9 month milestone can we see clearly enough.
			- Stating anticipated payroll is okay.
	- Every morning, verbalize these two things:
		- (1) What's the next big goal that we're striving toward in terms of Apex strategy?
		- (2) What's the biggest roadblock that's keeping us from getting there? this informs your focus for that day.
- Coaching meetings
	- Start each session with:
		- what is the company apex strategy?
		- map that down into functional areas?
			- Define a GTM that gets to Apex strategy
			- What is the GTM strategy, how do you know it's working, what have you learned about it at the level of GTM strategy?
				- E.g "fusion teams are never gonna work"

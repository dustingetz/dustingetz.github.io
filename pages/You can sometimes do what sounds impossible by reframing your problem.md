title:: You can sometimes do what sounds impossible by reframing your problem

- JOHN D COOK, [Life lessons from differential equations](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/07/23/life-lessons-from-differential-equations/)
	- 1. Some problems simply have no solution.
	- 2. Some problems have no simple solution.
	- 3. Some problems have many solutions.
	- 4. Determining that a solution exists may be half the work of finding it.
	- 5. Solutions that work well locally may blow up when extended too far.
	- 6. Boundary conditions are the hard part.
	- 7. Something that starts out as a good solution may become a very bad solution.
	- 8. You can fool yourself by constructing a solution where one doesn’t exist.
	- 9. Expand your possibilities to find a solution, then reduce them to see how good the solution is.
	- 10. You can sometimes do what sounds impossible by reframing your problem.

- I founded [Hyperfiddle](https://www.hyperfiddle.net/), a universal datagrid surface for building cloud GUIs, and [Electric Clojure](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric), an experimental programming language for ultra-dynamic stateful apps like word processors, spreadsheets, and IDEs.
- In the evenings I practice vibraphone and read math textbooks, currently (jan 2024) working through [Physics from Symmetry](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Symmetry-Undergraduate-Lecture-Notes-dp-3319666304/dp/3319666304/).

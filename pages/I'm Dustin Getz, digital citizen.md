alias:: Dustin Getz

- I'm an independent software researcher, funded by consulting, with 20 years experience in commercial UI development across all platforms from web to VR. My research interest is in the computational structure of user interfaces.
- ## Contact
	- https://twitter.com/dustingetz (private messages welcome!)
- ## Bio
	- I am the founder of Hyperfiddle, a "UI Notebook" for programmers.
	- At Hyperfiddle we develop [[Photon]], a full stack Clojure/Script dialect for UI that abstracts over the frontend/backend network separation, with managed client/server datasync built into the language runtime itself.
	- My long-term mission is to help people collaborate at scale with the structure and bandwidth of software. The first step in this is to tame runaway complexity in today’s information systems.
	- Giving back: I participate in Lindsay T the Lady Engineer's weekly program for female pre-seed founders.

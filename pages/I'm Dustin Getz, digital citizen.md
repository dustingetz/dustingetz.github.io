- I founded [Hyperfiddle](https://www.hyperfiddle.net/) and created [Electric Clojure](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric).
- I'm an independent software researcher with 20 years experience in commercial UI development across all platforms from web to VR.
- My research interest is in in the fine-grained computational structure of user interfaces and how that understanding maps upwards to application, system, enterprise and even web-scale structures.
- In the evenings I practice vibraphone and read math textbooks, currently [Atoms, Molecules and Optical Physics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3642543219).

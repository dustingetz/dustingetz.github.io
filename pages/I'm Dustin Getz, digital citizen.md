- Aphorisms
	- Opportunity is the space between your competitors' assumptions
	- Intuition is the opposite of reason
	- Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is just an opinion
	- Man errs because his will affirms or negates ideas that are not clear or distinct — Descartes
	- Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. — Muhammad Ali
	- [[You can’t find secrets without looking for them — Peter Theil]]
	- [[On Big Startup Ideas (2017)]]
	- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension — Nat Friedman
	- [[You Can't Tell People Anything (you have to show them)]]
	- [[The depth of any transaction is limited by the depth of the shallower party]]
	- Being understood is too big an ask because it requires controlling the other person's perspective. Try instead to communicate
	- Communication usually fails, except by accident
	- Again, define your terms, or we shall never understand one another — Voltaire
	- Everyone has an angle. If you don't see it, you're the sucker
	- Groups never admit failure, you get a schism instead
	- Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you — Steve Jobs
	- Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them
	- If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. Human potential manifests itself in individuals. — Dan Ingalls
	- [[Sufficiently Powerful Optimization Of Any Known Target Destroys All Value]]
	- [[Coordinating solutions to inadequate eqilibriums]]

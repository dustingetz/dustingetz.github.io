- I'm a software consultant and independent CS researcher, turned entrepreneur.
- I am the founder of [Hyperfiddle](https://www.hyperfiddle.net/), a "UI Notebook" for programmers.
	- Hyperfiddle is a fun/creative take on an enterprise application server, with viral product elements (yes really) – basically we're applying very modern/lightweight product led goto market motions to what is typically a crufty and heavy top-down space.
- I participate in Lindsay T the Lady Engineer's weekly program for female pre-seed founders.
- My long-term mission is to help people collaborate better/faster with software. The first step in this is to tame runaway complexity in today’s information systems.

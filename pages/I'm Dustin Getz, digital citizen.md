- I founded [Hyperfiddle](https://www.hyperfiddle.net/) and created [Electric Clojure](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric).
- I'm a computer scientist interested in the fine-grained computational structure of user interfaces.
- In the evenings I practice vibraphone and read math textbooks, currently (feb 2024) [Physics from Symmetry](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Symmetry-Undergraduate-Lecture-Notes-dp-3319666304/dp/3319666304/).

- Aphorisms
	- Assumptions are what gets you killed
	- Opportunity is the space between your competitors' assumptions
	- Intuition is the antonym of reason
	- Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is just an opinion
	- Man errs because his will affirms or negates ideas that are not clear or distinct — Descartes
	- Again, define your terms, or we shall never understand one another — Voltaire
	- [[The Curse of Development]]
	- Being understood is too big an ask because it requires controlling the other person's perspective. Try instead to communicate
	- Communication usually fails, except by accident
	- [[You Can't Tell People Anything (you have to show them)]]
	- Marketing is telling someone something that they already believe to be true
	- Everyone has an angle (some interest in the interaction). If you can't see it, you're the sucker
	- Groups never admit failure, you get a schism instead
	- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
	- Working with existing ideas is often mired in existing biases, sunk cost fallacies, and a shroud of confidentiality — all of which limit teams from taking off their blinders and really see the world of possibility.
	- Judgments are projections of the judge
	- Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. — Muhammad Ali
	- [[You can’t find secrets without looking for them — Peter Theil]]
	- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension — Nat Friedman
	- If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. Human potential manifests in individuals. — Dan Ingalls
	- Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them
